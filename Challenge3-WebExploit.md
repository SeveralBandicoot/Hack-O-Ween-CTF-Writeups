# Challenge 3: DOM Analysis and Hidden Attribute Exploitation

The goal of this challenge was to exploit a **Broken Access Control/Client-Side Security** vulnerability by analyzing the **Document Object Model (DOM)** for hidden HTML elements and attributes to find a concealed flag.

The webpage featured three distinct display modes: Default, Light, and Scary.

## Tools Used
* **Browser Developer Tools (Inspect Element):** Used for dynamic analysis of the webpage's DOM, CSS, and element attributes.
* **Search Functionality:** Used within the Elements panel for targeted reconnaissance.

## Thought Process

1.  **Initial Reconnaissance:** Based on the hint of "invisible attributes," I immediately used the browser's Developer Tools (Inspect Element) to examine the source code and structure of the webpage.

2.  **State Observation:** I observed the changes in the Elements panel while switching between the three display modes (Default, Light, and Scary) to identify which attributes or classes were being modified client-side.

3.  **Discovery of Hidden Elements:** I identified that certain `div` elements were conditionally hidden using the standard HTML `hidden` attribute. For example, an element might appear as: `<div class="bigDev" hidden>...</div>`. This attribute visually conceals the element on the page, matching the challenge's hint regarding invisible attributes.

4.  **Targeted Search:** I reasoned that since we were looking for a Capture The Flag (CTF) element, the string "flag" would be present. I utilized the search functionality within the Elements tab of the Developer Tools to search for the string "flag" across all modes.

5.  **Flag Location:** The string "flag" was successfully located within a hidden element. Further analysis showed this element became fully visible (the `hidden` attribute was removed) only when the **"Scary"** mode was active in the browser.

6.  **Flag Extraction:** By examining the full contents of the identified `div` element in the Elements panel, the hidden value was revealed.

## Result

The hidden flag and its value were successfully extracted from the webpage's source code by exploiting the client-side security flaw.

**Flag:** `flame{D00MI$C0MING}`
